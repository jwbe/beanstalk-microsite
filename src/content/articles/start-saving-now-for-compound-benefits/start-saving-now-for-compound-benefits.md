As parents we all know that one day our babies will grow to be young adults and with that will come new financial challenges for them. Will they be able to afford a car, college fees, a deposit on their first home…? 

Whatever it it that your child may need, you can do something positive now to help set them up for the future. By setting aside money, little and often now, you will be amazed at how it will accumulate and provide your child with a really useful pot of money when they become a young adult.

This approach means that you won’t feel so much burden to find a large sum of money later, instead you can painlessly save smaller sums now. Plus any money you save now will benefit from compound interest creating a larger total.

## What is Compound interest?

Interest is applied to a some of money, that means the total goes up. Then interest is applied to that new higher total and the total goes up by a larger amount.  

The more times  you allow interest to be applied to your total, the more growth you will benefit from – that is why starting early means you end up with more.
