Make saving an easy habit with Round Ups. See your recent transactions and swipe to round up to the nearest £1 and invest the change into your beanstalk accounts. Here's how it works.

Through the government backed Open Banking scheme you give your bank permission to securely display your data to you within the Beanstalk app.

Swipe to round up and the change will be added to your running total for the week. For example: if you bought a sandwich for £2.50, you can choose to save 50p.

You can also set to automatically round up which will add the change from your purchases once they are 7 days old.

And if you are worried the round up total is too big, you can adjust it at any point.
