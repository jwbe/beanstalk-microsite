We want your children to benefit from their investment so we have no charges and offer one of the most competitive fees on the market meaning you can save more for your child

Beanstalk is a stocks and shares Junior ISA, meaning your child will benefit from tax free growth on their savings

We have taken out the complexity and offer you a simple choice of two funds – one low risk and one that tracks the market – split your child’s savings however you like between the two funds and adjust it whenever you want

We will not lock you in to a monthly commitment, you can start with as little as £1 – even that could be worth £x in ten years’ time.
