subheading: Why Beanstalk and how we help families build a lump sum to give their children the best possible launch into adult life

Ten years ago, I co-founded KidStart, the free shopping club for parents that has helped thousands of families save millions of pounds for free for their children when shopping at over 2,000 retailers.

From talking to parents with KidStart we could see that the savings market for kids was broken. Almost every new parent wants to put something aside for their children to help launch them into adult life, but very few do.

Parents know their children face a tougher time than they did – university fees, housing costs, cost of living – but tell us it is hard to know what to do: putting money aside is tough; the choices are confusing making it difficult to decide what is right; and the products out there are often poor value, expensive or require commitment.

Even when parents do something, they often just keep it in cash. This may not be the right choice for longer term saving as the value can be eroded by inflation.

That’s why we’ve created Beanstalk – the revolutionary new way for families to make a real difference for their children.

* It’s simple – you can add all your children and yourself on to one app.
* All the family can help – Beanstalk lets grandparents, friends and the wider family to all contribute easily to your kids’ pots.
* You don’t need to put any money into open an account and start saving– whatever your family’s budget, we are here to help. Use KidStart to earn free savings, round ups to save little and often, top up or set up regular contributions if you would like.

We are proud to be bringing child savings into the 21st Century!
