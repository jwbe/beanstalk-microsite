      "I looked at setting up a savings account for my daughter, Carmen, when she was born, but it always seemed too complicated, with too many choices to make, I had no idea if I was doing the right thing or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've found Beanstalk to be very straight-forward, I just downloaded the app and in two minutes it was all set-up. It's so simple that the grandparents can quickly and easily contribute. The KidStart savings and round up functions mean that our shopping is adding to her savings, and even buying a coffee or sandwich can top up the account."

      Richard, Marketing Consultant and Dad to Merryn and Noah
    </Subheading>
    <p>"We initially opened a stocks and shares Junior ISA because our two children had inherited some money from their grandma and it was important that it was put away for their future.</p>
    <p>Where Beanstalk has made a real difference is that rather than this being a one-off payment, when their other grandparents said they wanted to start putting away some money each month for all their grandchildren, all we had to do was simply invite them from the Beanstalk app and they had all the information they needed. This simplicity and flexibility make a real difference."</p>

      Ozlem, Maths Teacher and Mum to Arda
    </Subheading>
    <p>"My son had a Child Trust Fund which was being charged 1.5% per year. We found it difficult to stay on top of what was going on with his account. I had already saved £200 by using KidStart and, when they launched their Beanstalk Junior ISA, I looked into how much we could be saving on fees.</p>
    <p>It was easy to transfer Arda’s CTF and I love the fact that we can keep track of his account through the app."</p>

    <Subheading>
      Chris, Dad to Rachel, Olly and Nathanael 
    </Subheading>
    <p>"Both Rachel and Olly had Child Trust Funds dating back to when they were born, and even though we’d been making payments into them it wasn’t until we came to move house that we really paid them much attention. Just changing the correspondence address for the accounts was hard, never mind trying to find out actually how much was in each of them. There had to be an easier way!</p>
    <p>From the very first contact with Beanstalk it felt like there was a personal touch, rather than automated responses from a computer. Now, rather than an annual statement which gets filed away probably until we next move house, I can check their JISA account on the Beanstalk App whenever I like."</p>

    </Subheading>
    <p>"We opened a Beanstalk account for our son Tomos. Registering was very straight-forward and we've found Beanstalk very easy to use. It's great that we can check the balance whenever we want.</p>
    <p>I invited my partner, Tammy, to become a donor so we can both contribute to Tomos' account. I have set-up a £10 regular contribution and Tammy is using Beanstalk's round up feature to save the spare change from her purchases. I'd recommend Beanstalk to friends and family as it's a brilliant way to put something aside for the children."</p>

    I can’t believe how easy this is to use! A great app easy to navigate around. If I was to ask for one thing it would be to see how much has been paid in each week/month from D/D S/O and round ups. My Girls love to see how their JISA’s are growing. I would definitely recommend this app.
