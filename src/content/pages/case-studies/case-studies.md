      "I looked at setting up a savings account for my daughter, Carmen, when she was born, but it always seemed too complicated, with too many choices to make, I had no idea if I was doing the right thing or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've found Beanstalk to be very straight forward, I just downloaded the app and in two minutes it was all set-up. It's so simple that the grandparents can quickly and easily contribute to Carmen's future with none of the hassle of having to pay birthday or Christmas cash or cheques into the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The KidStart savings and round up functions mean that our shopping is adding to her savings, and even buying a coffee or sandwich can top up the account."

      "Saving for the children’s JISA is a real family effort"

      Richard, Marketing Consultant and Dad to Merryn and Noah
    </Subheading>
    <p>"We initially opened a stocks and shares Junior ISA because our two children had inherited some money from their grandma and it was important that it was put away for their future.</p>
    <p>Where Beanstalk has made a real difference is that rather than this being a one-off payment, when their other grandparents said they wanted to start putting away some money each month for all their grandchildren, all we had to do was simply invite them from the Beanstalk app and they had all the information they needed.</p><p>This simplicity and flexibility make a real difference. And it has to be said, being able to answer the grandparents’ question ‘Do the kids have Junior ISAs yet?’ with an immediate ‘Yes – and let me show you and invite you right now!’ made me feel like I’d won at least one parenting point from them!"</p>

      "It was easy to transfer my son’s CTF to a Junior ISA"
    </Heading>
    <Subheading>
      Ozlem, Maths Teacher and Mum to Arda
    </Subheading>
    <p>"My son had a Child Trust Fund which was being charged 1.5% per year. We found it difficult to stay on top of what was going on with his account. I had already saved £200 by using KidStart and, when they launched their Beanstalk Junior ISA, I looked into how much we could be saving on fees.</p>
    <p>It was easy to transfer Arda’s CTF and I love the fact that we can keep track of his account through the app. We can also manage our regular contributions very easily – at the moment I’m able to save a bit more but if things change I can simply change the amount via the app.</p>
    <p>When he has access to his money at 18, Arda's Dad would like him to put it towards setting up a small business. I think he would like to spend some of his money on travelling because he says he wants to be an explorer when he grows up; a typical Sagittarian!"</p>

    </Heading>
    <Subheading>
      Chris, CEO of a multi-academy trust for schools in Northamptonshire and Dad to Rachel, Olly and Nathanael 
    </Subheading>
    <p>"Both Rachel and Olly had Child Trust Funds dating back to when they were born, and even though we’d been making payments into them it wasn’t until we came to move house that we really paid them much attention. Just changing the correspondence address for the accounts was hard, never mind trying to find out actually how much was in each of them. There had to be an easier way!</p>
    <p>From the very first contact with Beanstalk it felt like there was a personal touch, rather than automated responses from a computer. Now, rather than an annual statement which gets filed away probably until we next move house, I can check their JISA account on the Beanstalk App whenever I like."</p>
