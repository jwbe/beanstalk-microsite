## Invest your change for the future

Make saving an easy habit with Round Ups. See your recent transactions and swipe to round up to the nearest £1 and invest the change into your beanstalk accounts.

Through the Open Banking scheme, you can give your bank permission to securely display your data to you within the Beanstalk app. 

For example, if you bought a sandwich for £2.50, you can choose to ‘round up’ to £3 and invest the 50p change. 

Set Auto Round up and we will collect the change on all transactions for the week – you’ll be surprised at how it can add up.

If your total is under £5 it will roll on to the next week or you can edit the total to keep the pot growing.
