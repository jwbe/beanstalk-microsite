## About Beanstalk

Beanstalk was crated by KidStart, who have been helping thousands of families save millions of pounds for their kids over the last ten years.

KidStart looked at the savings market for kids and thought it was broken, that's why they created Beanstalk - to make it easier and more worthwhile for parents to put something away for their kid's future.
