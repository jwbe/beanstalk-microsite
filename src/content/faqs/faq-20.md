Through Beanstalk, you can invite family and friends to save for any or all of your children. This will send them an email invite which they can accept or decline through their own app. If they accept, then they can use Beanstalk to contribute to your child.

You will be able to see any contributions they make.  They will be able to view the contributions they have made to your children, but will not be able to view information on total value or contributions that you have made.
