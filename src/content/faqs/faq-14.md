You can ask to withdraw money from your ISA at any time. If the money you wish to withdraw is held in investments, these will be sold on the next trading day which could be 7-10 working days after your request. Payments will be made to the bank account linked to your Beanstalk account via BACS once the cash is available within your account and this could take a further 5 working days.

You can only make one withdrawal request at any time.

Please note: investments in a Stocks & Shares ISA should be regarded as longer term investments.
