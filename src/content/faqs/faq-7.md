The child must be a UK permanent resident aged under 16 at time of application.

To open an account for a child, you must be the parent or legal guardian of the child and aged over 18. If the child has an existing Stocks & Shares JISA or a Child Trust Fund, you **must** transfer it to Beanstalk as children cannot have more than one Stocks & Shares JISA.  (Note: a child can have both a cash and a Stocks & Shares JISA at the same time.)
