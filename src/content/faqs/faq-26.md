Through Beanstalk you can set up a direct debit(s) to enable contributions and gifts to be taken.  The direct debit must come from a bank account in your name and we will carry out verification checks on this. We will use separate direct debits for each account you have set up.

We will notify you by email when the direct debit instruction has been set up. this will typically be within a couple of days but can be delayed if we require further information from you. In these cases, we will let you know by email when the instruction will be set up.

Direct debits are covered by the direct debit guarantee as outlined on the direct debit instruction and in the direct debit confirmation email that we send you.
