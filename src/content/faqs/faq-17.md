The L&G Cash Trust invests in lower risk, lower return investments such as short term deposits, government bonds and similar. The returns from a portfolio which is 100% invested in the L&G cash trust may be lower than putting money into a cash ISA or JISA with a bank or building society so we don’t allow this.
