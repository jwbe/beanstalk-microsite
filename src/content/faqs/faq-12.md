You must be over 18 and resident in the UK. We do not accept applications from US citizens. You cannot subscribe to more than one Stocks & Shares ISA in the current tax year; if you have done so, you will need to transfer this to Beanstalk.

The Beanstalk ISA requires a contribution of at least Â£10 to open. There is no requirement to set up a regular payment unless you want to.
