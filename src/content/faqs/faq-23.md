The app shows you purchases that you have made over the last 7 days. These are updated once a day so today you will see any purchases you made yesterday along with the round up amount. To round up you swipe the purchase to the right.

When you round up a purchase, the round up amount is added to the running total of round ups you have made during the week. You can manually adjust change this running total up or down at any point through the App.

Through the app, you can enable /disable “auto round up”. Auto round up will automatically round up any purchase after 7 days.
