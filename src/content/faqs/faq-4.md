Beanstalk has a simple and inexpensive fee structure, which consists an annual fee equal to 0.5% of the value of any Beanstalk Account.

The funds we offer have annual charges deducted directly from the funds themselves of 0.12-0.15%.

More details on charging are available in the terms and conditions; for example we may charge for paper copies of statements.
