Buying and selling of funds happens once a week, normally on a Tuesday (or the working day after if a holiday). This is known as the 'order day' in our terms.

We use the allocation that is set on your account at midday on the previous working day to determine the allocation that is applied to any new contributions received at that point.

Only contributions that are cleared in your account by 4pm on the day before the order day are included in the calculation. Direct debit payments can be occasionally clawed back through the banking system once they have been received, so we therefore wait a couple of days before clearing these payments for investment.

If you change your allocation, we will automatically create trades for the next trading day to adjust your existing holdings to your new allocations as well as changing how your contributions are invested going forward.

For example: if your existing holdings are 90% by value in one fund and 10% in the other, moving your allocation to 50:50 will result in selling one fund and buying the other so that you end up with 50:50.

This process can take 7 working days as we have to wait for the proceeds from the sale to settle before buying the other fund.
