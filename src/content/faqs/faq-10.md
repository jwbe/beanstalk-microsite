Prior to their 18th birthday, we will contact the child through you to advise that they will become the owner of the Junior ISA and can access the savings. On the child’s 18th birthday, the Junior ISA automatically converts into an adult ISA and the child will become legally entitled to manage the account. We will explain to the child how they can take over the account at that point.

Under HMRC rules, money cannot be withdrawn before the child’s 18th birthday except in the case of the child’s death or a terminal illness.
