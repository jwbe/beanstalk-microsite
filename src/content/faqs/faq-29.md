We collect one off top ups and regular monthly contributions at different times as detailed below. We will notify you by email in advance of:

i) A first regular monthly contribution or any changes to timing and amount thereafter;
ii) All one-off top ups or payments.

### Regular Contributions

We collect regular contributions on the 18th of each month. If the 18th falls on a weekend or clashes with a public holiday then the collection date will be the first working day after the 18th.

We send payment instructions to the bank 5 working days in advance of the 18th. This means that if you set up or request a change to the regular instruction within 5 working days of the 18th, the change will be made the following month.

We will notify you by email 5 working days in advance of a new regular contribution or any change to the timing and amount thereafter.

### One off top ups

We typically collect one off top ups weekly on Wednesdays. If the Wednesday clashes with a public holiday, then the collection date will be the first working day after.

We send payment instructions to the bank 5 working days in advance. This means that if you request a top up, we will collect it on Wednesday week after you requested the top up.

We will confirm your top up to you by email 5 working days in advance of collection so you know the exact day it is going.

We will notify you by email for every top up 5 working days in advance of collection.
