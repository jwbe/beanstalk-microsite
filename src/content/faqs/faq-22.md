heading: How does the round up tool work?
---

The round up tool uses the Government-backed Open Banking initiative through which you can give your bank permission to let us securely display your bank data to you. This is read only, with no access to change any of your details or make transactions.

We have partnered with OpenWrks, an FCA Authorised Account Information Service Provider, who manage the connection to your bank.  To enable round ups, you need to give consent to your bank which you do through the links in the App.

If you have given permission, the round up tool displays your recent purchases and you can decide which to round up.  The total round ups are collected from your bank by direct debit on a weekly basis.

Any round ups you make will be split between all the Beanstalk accounts you are linked to. For example: if you have 2 children and an account for yourself and you round up £5, each will receive £1.66 (with 1p left over!)
