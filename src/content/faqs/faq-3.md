Through the App you need to set up a Beanstalk Account for anyone you wish to save for (your children and/or yourself). If you have been invited to save for a child, their account will have been set up already by the parent.

The Beanstalk Account is a simple and flexible account through which any contributions are invested at your choice in the funds we offer.  The Beanstalk child account is a Stocks & Shares Junior ISA and requires no minimum contribution to open.  The Beanstalk adult account is a Stocks & Shares ISA which can be opened with just Â£10.
