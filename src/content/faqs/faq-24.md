heading: When will the round ups be collected?

The total round ups are collected from your bank by direct debit on a weekly basis as follows.

Every Monday, the weekly round up total for the previous week is calculated and the round up total is reset. We will notify you by email of the total amount to be collected through your direct debit and when it will be collected.

The direct debit is typically submitted to your bank for collection on the following Monday (or nearest working day after) at which point it will be split and allocated between the Beanstalk accounts you are linked to.

Note: the minimum direct debit value we can collect is Â£5. If your round up total is less than this, then no payment will be taken and it will carry forward the following week.
