heading: What is the name on the direct debit?

Money collected via direct debit is put into a client money bank account operated under FCA client money and asset rules by our FCA authorised platform provider, Third Platform Services Limited. You will therefore see that the direct debit instruction is in favour of Third Platform Services Limited and the name on the payment on your bank account will be “TPS re KidStart / KidSave” (depending on how much information your bank shows you on your account.)
