Purchases and sales of funds through Beanstalk are made once a week on Tuesdays (or the working day after if a holiday). We use the allocation that is set at midday on your account on the previous working day to determine the allocation that is applied to any new contributions received at that point.

If you change your allocation, we will automatically create trades for the next trading day to adjust your existing holdings to your new allocations as well as changing how your contributions are invested going forward.  For example: if your existing holdings are 90% by value in one fund and 10% in the other, moving your allocation to 50:50 will result in selling one fund and buying the other so that you end up with 50:50. This process can take 7 working days as we have to wait for the proceeds from the sale to settle before buying the other fund.
