The Beanstalk app brings together a number of tools to help you put money aside for yourself and your kids.

Through the app, you can see all of your accounts in one place, invite family and friends to link to your children, and set up one off or regular contributions.  You can collect free savings on your shopping at KidStartâ€™s 2300+ retail partners and use our round ups tool to round up purchases you make and save the balance.

Grandparents and other donors can use their own Beanstalk app to contribute in the same great ways and can send and receive messages with the gifts they make.
