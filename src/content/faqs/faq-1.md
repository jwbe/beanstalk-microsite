heading: Why can't I download the Beanstalk app?
---

The beanstalk app is in the final stages of development and testing, it is not available for download just yet. However, you can register your interest and we will email you when the Beanstalk app is available to [download](/contact).

We recommend that, if you haven't already, you sign up to [KidStart](https://www.kidstart.co.uk) and start building savings for your child in the KidSave account â€“ they will appear in your Beanstalk app once it's available.
