Beanstalk is a mobile app designed to help families work together to save money for their childrenâ€™s future.

The Beanstalk app makes it easy to build a meaningful pot of money for when your children reach 18 to give them the best possible launch into adult life.

Through the app, you can open accounts for all your children, and yourself, and then use our tools to put money aside. Grandparents and other friends / family can link using their Beanstalk app to your children so they can also help out.
