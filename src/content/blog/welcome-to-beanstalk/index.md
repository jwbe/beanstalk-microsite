description: Find out why we launched Beanstalk and why it's a revolutionary app
  that is bringing child savings into the 21st century!

Ten years ago, we co-founded KidStart and are proud that we have since helped thousands of families save millions of pounds for free for their children when shopping at over 2,300 retailers.

From our experience with [KidStart](https://www.kidstart.co.uk/), it was clear that the savings market for kids was broken. Parents told us that they wanted to put something aside for their children to help launch them into adult life, but found it hard to do so: putting money aside is tough; the choices are confusing making it difficult to decide what is right; and the products out there are often poor value, expensive or require commitment.

Even when parents do something, they often just keep it in cash because it seems simpler. However given the interest rates on offer, this may not be the right choice for saving over a long time as the value can be eroded by inflation.

That’s why we’ve created [Beanstalk](https://beanstalkapp.co.uk/) – the revolutionary new app that makes saving for your kids easy.

• It’s simple – you can add all your children and yourself on to one app in a just a minute or two.
• All the family can help – invite grandparents, friends and the wider family and they can all contribute directly to your kids’ pots.
• You don’t need to make a contribution up front to open an account – we want to help all families whatever your circumstances. Use KidStart to earn free savings, round ups to save little and often, top up or set up regular contributions if and when you would like.

6 months in and we already have thousands of parents signed up and millions collectively in their accounts.  Customer feedback is great – just check out [Trustpilot](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/beanstalkapp.co.uk), [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/beanstalk-save-for-your-kids/id1470619597) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beanstalk).

We are proud to be bringing child savings into the 21st century!
